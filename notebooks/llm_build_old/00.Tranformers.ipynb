    "The first step is to convert human-readable text into smaller, machine-readable chunks called **tokens**.\n",

    "# How GPT-3 Works: The Magic Behind the Next Word\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered what's happening under the hood when a tool like GPT-3 or ChatGPT instantly generates a coherent and human-like response? The process, while complex, can be broken down into a series of logical steps. At its heart, GPT-3 is an incredibly powerful prediction machine, designed to do one thing exceptionally well: predict the next word in a sequence. This is the magic behind every poem, email, or line of code it writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a model like GPT-3 predicts the missing word \"Snape\" in the sentence \"Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy ... least favorite teacher, professor ??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Tokenization (BPE)\n",
    "The very first step is to translate the human-readable text into a format the model can understand. This process is called tokenization. GPT-3 uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which breaks down text into smaller units called tokens. These aren't just whole words; they can be parts of words or common symbols, making the model highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Sentence:** \"Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy ... least favorite teacher, professor ??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Tokens:** [\"Harry\", \" Potter\", \" was\", \" a\", \" highly\", \" unusual\", \" boy\", \"...\", \" least\", \" favorite\", \" teacher\", \",\", \" professor\", \" ??\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output IDs:** [11112, 23450, 312, 234, 1222, 5431, 2390, 891, 7654, 9876, 2343, 11, 4567, 98]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each token is then mapped to a unique integer ID from the model's large vocabulary of 50,257 tokens. This transforms the text into a sequence of numbers, which is the actual input for the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "![transformer](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240729154418/Transformer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Embedding + Positional Encoding\n",
    "Next, these token IDs are converted into a more meaningful representation: a high-dimensional vector. This process is called embedding. Each token ID is looked up in a massive table, which maps it to a vector of 12,288 dimensions. This vector captures the token's semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tell the model about the order of the words, a positional encoding vector is added to each token's embedding. This unique vector tells the model the exact position of each token in the sequence (e.g., \"Harry\" is at position 0, \"Potter\" at position 1, and so on). Together, the embedding and positional encoding create a single, powerful vector that encodes both the token's meaning and its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's context window is the maximum number of tokens it can process at once (e.g., 2048 tokens for some versions of GPT-3). For computational efficiency, all input sequences are padded to this fixed length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input IDs:** [11112, 23450, 312, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Matrix:** A matrix where each row is a token's vector. The shape would be [14 tokens × 12,288 dimensions], which is then padded to [2048 × 12,288] for batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: The Transformer Decoder Blocks (×96)\n",
    "The core of GPT-3 is a stack of 96 Transformer decoder blocks. Each block refines the token vectors by applying two key mechanisms that allow the model to understand the relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
    "This is where the model determines which words are most relevant to each other to establish context. For example, when processing the token \"professor,\" the model's query for context finds a high similarity with the keys of \"teacher,\" \"favorite,\" and \"Harry Potter.\" This tells the model what information is most important for making its prediction.\n",

    "The multi-head part means the model does this not once, but in parallel across multiple \"heads,\" each of which learns to focus on a different aspect of the sentence (e.g., one head might focus on grammatical relationships, while another focuses on character names). The masked part ensures the model cannot \"cheat\" by looking at the future token it's trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's how it works at a matrix level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating the Query, Key, and Value Matrices:** The input is a matrix of token embeddings, X, with a shape of [T × d_model]. For each attention head, the model learns three separate weight matrices (W_Q, W_K, and W_V) to project X into three new matrices: Q (Query), K (Key), and V (Value). The dimensions of these new matrices are d_k and d_v, which are typically smaller than d_model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Matrix (Q):** Represents what each token is \"looking for.\" Q = XW_Q. Output shape: [T × d_k]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Matrix (K):** Represents what each token \"contains\" to be found. K = XW_K. Output shape: [T × d_k]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value Matrix (V):** Contains the actual content information for each token. V = XW_V. Output shape: [T × d_v]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculating Attention Scores:** The dot product of the Query and Key matrices is calculated to find the similarity between every pair of tokens. This creates a matrix of attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Scores Matrix:** AttentionScores = QK^T. Output shape: [T × T].\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is the heart of the attention mechanism. Each element (i, j) represents how much token i should \"pay attention\" to token j. In a decoder, a mask is applied to this matrix to prevent tokens from looking at future tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scores are then scaled by the square root of d_k and a softmax function is applied, normalizing the scores into a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generating the Output Matrix:** The normalized attention weights are then multiplied by the Value matrix V. This creates a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are the attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\n",
    "After attention, each token's vector is processed by a two-layer neural network. This network adds abstract features and non-linearities, helping the model learn more complex patterns, such as recognizing that the current context is likely a slot for a character's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Matrix:** [14 × 12,288] (from Step 2)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Final Linear Layer + Softmax\n",
    "The final step is to use the deeply contextualized vector of the last token, \"??\", to make a prediction. This vector is passed through a final linear layer that projects it back to the size of the vocabulary (50,257). The output of this layer is a list of scores, called logits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Softmax function is then applied to these logits, converting them into a probability distribution where the probabilities of all possible next tokens sum to 1. Based on the context \"Harry Potter... least favorite teacher, professor,\" the model would assign the highest probabilities to the most likely candidates:\n",

    "**Output Shape:** [1 × 50,257]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Autoregressive Generation\n",

    "# How BERT Works: The Magic Behind Understanding Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how a model like BERT can understand the meaning\n",
    "of a sentence, answer questions, or detect sentiment? Unlike GPT, which\n",
    "is designed to *predict the next word*, BERT is built to deeply\n",
    "understand the **entire sentence in context**. This makes it especially\n",
    "powerful for tasks like search engines, question answering, and\n",
    "sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, BERT is not trying to write the next word---it's trying to\n",
    "**grasp meaning** by looking at all the words at once. Let's break down\n",
    "how BERT works with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want BERT to figure out the missing word in this sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy. His least favorite teacher was\n",
    "Professor \\[MASK\\].\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "We want BERT to predict the masked word (\"Snape\") based on the entire\n",
    "context.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Tokenization (WordPiece)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like GPT, BERT starts by breaking the text into smaller pieces\n",
    "called tokens. BERT uses **WordPiece tokenization**, which breaks rare\n",
    "words into subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Sentence:**\\\n",
    "\"Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy. His least favorite teacher was\n",
    "Professor \\[MASK\\].\"\n",

    "**Output Tokens:**\\\n",
    "\\[\"\\[CLS\\]\", \"Harry\", \"Potter\", \"was\", \"a\", \"highly\", \"unusual\", \"boy\",\n",

    "-   `[CLS]` is a special classification token added at the start.\\\n",
    "-   `[SEP]` marks the end of a sentence.\\\n",
    "-   `[MASK]` is a placeholder telling BERT to guess this word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each token is then mapped to an ID, just like GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Embedding + Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Every token ID is converted into a high-dimensional vector. But BERT\n",
    "embeddings are richer than GPT's---they include three kinds of\n",
    "information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Token Embedding:** The meaning of the token (e.g., \"Harry\").\\\n",
    "2.  **Segment Embedding:** Whether the token belongs to sentence A or B\n",
    "    (for tasks like Question + Answer).\\\n",
    "3.  **Position Embedding:** The token's position in the sequence (so\n",
    "    BERT knows word order).\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors are summed up into one embedding for each token, forming\n",
    "the input matrix:\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Transformer Encoder Blocks (×12 or ×24)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where BERT differs most from GPT. Instead of a **decoder-only\n",
    "stack** like GPT, BERT uses **encoder-only Transformer blocks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Bidirectional Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT's attention mechanism looks at *all* words at once, both left and\n",
    "right.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When guessing `[MASK] = \"Snape\"`, BERT doesn't just look left\n",
    "    (\"Professor\") or right (\".\"), it also considers context like \"least\n",
    "    favorite teacher\" earlier in the sentence.\\\n",
    "-   This bidirectional nature allows it to truly understand context,\n",
    "    unlike GPT, which can only look backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, it works the same way as GPT's attention:\\\n",
    "- Each token generates a Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).\\\n",
    "- Attention scores = QK\\^T, normalized by softmax.\\\n",
    "- Each token becomes a **weighted combination of all other tokens**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But unlike GPT, there's **no masking**---BERT is allowed to see the full\n",
    "sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "After attention, each token's vector goes through a small neural network\n",
    "that enriches its representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Contextualized embeddings, where each token now \"knows\" its\n",
    "meaning relative to the full sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: The Output Head (Masked Language Modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the special trick: BERT was trained with the **Masked Language\n",
    "Model (MLM)** objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some tokens (like \"Snape\") are replaced with `[MASK]`.\\\n",
    "-   BERT must predict the original word using all surrounding context.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Input Vector (for \\[MASK\\]):** \\[1 × 768\\]\\\n",
    "**Logits Vector:** \\[1 × 30,000\\] (BERT's vocab size)\n",

    "After applying **Softmax**, BERT assigns probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   P(\"Snape\") = 0.83\\\n",
    "-   P(\"Dumbledore\") = 0.06\\\n",
    "-   P(\"McGonagall\") = 0.04\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Fine-Tuning for Specific Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike GPT, which is mostly used for text generation, BERT is designed\n",
